    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>I am currently working as an Insurance Claims Specialist and looking to move into a career in Web Development</p>
    <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
    <p>I was born/raised in a small town named Wewahitchka, Florida.</p>
    <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
    <p>I like to dabble in a lot of things. My main hobbies are video games, digital art, and playing music (I play
      Euphonium!)</p>
    <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
    <p>I'm still figuring it out, but I've recently really been drawn into becoming a Full Stack Developer by doing some
      self-learning on different coding websites.</p>
    <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
    <p>I moved to the PNW in 2014 and currently live in the Edmonds, Washington area.</p>
    <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
    <p>I accept about myself that I have OCD. I'm learning that coding lets me use what I considered a flaw for a long
      time to be creative and work towards making some really awesome things.</p>
